00_setup
1) The README for the repo states that we will be using both the Windows 2016 and CentOS 7 environments but the labs only use the CentOS machine.

01_apache
1) We should probably have tree installed on these AMIs.

02_test-kitchen
1) I assume there aren't lab procedures yet because you had to switch it to CentOS?
2) What size of instance are you using for the AWS CentOS machine considering that the .kitchen.yml file has both Ubuntu and CentOS platforms?
