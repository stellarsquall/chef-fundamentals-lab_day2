# Chef Fundamentals Lab - Day 2
Hands-on exercises for Chef Fundamentals training

## Purpose

This repo is designed to accompany the hands-on Chef Fundamentals training course. The Day 2 exercises are dedicated to an apache lab exercise, an introduction to test-kitchen, ohai and node attributes, getting started with a Chef Server, and managing dependencies for community cookbooks.

## Lab Environment

These exercises should be completed within the provided Windows 2016 and CentOS 7 training environments.

Your instructor will provide you with login information during the training. This code is _not_ intended to be executed on a learner's local machine.

## Resources

The training references the [Chef Documentation](https://docs.chef.io) to encourage learners to look up information and become self-sufficient in troubleshooting. If the documentation cannot be accessed behind your firewall, you can alternatively access the [chef-web-docs](https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs) GitHub page, or the older [Chef12 DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/chef~12/) pages for reference. If none of these are accessible, please make this known to your instructor.

Let's jump into the kitchen!
